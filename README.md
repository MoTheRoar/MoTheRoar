#### Happy to see you here!

I am a data science / machine learning enthuistiast. Whenever I am not working, I am either attempting a challenge found on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/'>kaggle</a>

After completing Andrew Ng's specialization course on machine learning, I am trying to solve regression / classification problems from the ground up and then implementing them through a python library. Doing so makes me appreciate the work developers have put to make the world easier.
